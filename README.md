# 🚀 Offensive Message Detection in Arabic Darija

This project focuses on building a **classification model** to determine whether a message is **offensive** or **not** in **Arabic Darija**.  
The model has practical applications, such as:  
✅ **Filtering offensive comments**  
✅ **Detecting hate speech & harmful content**

## 📌 Project Steps

### 🔍 1. Data Gathering  
- 📥 Collected a **high-quality dataset** with labeled offensive and non-offensive messages.  
- 🔎 Found an existing **Data set** online for reference.  

### 📊 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Used **Pandas** to analyze and clean the dataset.  
- Identified missing values, text patterns, and class imbalances.  

### 🏗 3. Feature Engineering  
- Converted text data into numerical form using **Vectorization (TF-IDF / CountVectorizer)**.  

### 🎯 4. Model Selection  
- Selected **Logistic Regression** as the classification model.  

### ✂️ 5. Splitting Data  
- Split the dataset into **training (80%)** and **testing (20%)** for evaluation.  

### 📈 6. Model Evaluation  
- Measured accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to validate performance.  

### 🛠 7. Running Custom Tests  
- Tested the model with **real-world Arabic Darija messages** to assess its accuracy.

## 🚀 Future Improvements  
🔹 Train with a **larger dataset** for better accuracy.  
🔹 Experiment with **deep learning models (LSTMs, Transformers)** for improved results.  
🔹 Deploy the model as an **API** for real-time detection.
